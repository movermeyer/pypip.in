# pypip.in

Some time ago, [pypip.in](https://web.archive.org/web/20150318013508/https://pypip.in/) badge provider shut down. This broke the badges for thousands of repositories:

The pypip.in domain was then bought and made to redirect incoming requests to the still-operational [shields.io](https://shields.io) badge service.

This repo contains the website files that are hosted at pypip.in.
